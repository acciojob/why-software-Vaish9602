    <p>
      I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating things that can make people's lives easier. 
      Technology is constantly evolving, and being a developer allows me to be part of that change. 
      I love the idea of turning ideas into real applications through code, and Iâ€™m motivated by the continuous learning and creativity that this field offers.
